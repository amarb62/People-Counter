# People-Counter
People counting systems aim at automatically estimating the number of people indoor and outdoor places. The aim of the project is to mitigate the problem of overcrowding in mess. Generally, a place has been constructed to accumulate a certain amount of people. But what if, when the place gets overcrowded and there is no place to sit and dine. So, by using the emerging technologies we can develop some tool to automate the space problem. We can beforehand let everybody know about how much percentage space has been used. The people counting technology is widely used in retail environment, determining conversion ratio, advertising and promotional evaluations. And they can be used for transportation management system and space management.
